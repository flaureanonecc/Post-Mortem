#  Final Prompts

## 1. Are you proud of your finished deliverables? Why/Why not?

I am proud of my deliverables. I worked really hard on them, and I think that the effort is shown in my work. In the documentation that I've written, I've tried to look at it from the perspective of someone who is a little green in the field and is trying to learn more about the technology I'm writing about. I think that writing it for the newbie in mind helps the content be consumed by far more people than if I left breadcrumbs. At times I can be handholdy with the instructions, but that's something that I actually enjoy at times in my professional life. I cannot tell you how many times I've watched installation guides or read manuals where they skip over steps that, to the writer, seem obvious, but to someone who's not as experienced, it only causes me to get lost while I search for this missing link. My weakest aspect entering this class was the scripting in Linux, which has improved but is still my weakest skill. We do have a few Linux servers at work, but none of them need anything scripted, so most of my experience comes from PowerShell. That being said, this class has helped me become more confident in my Linux scripting abilities, and for that I am grateful.

## 2. What was the most frustrating/hard part? Why?

The most difficult part about the course was the Linux scripting. I am a PowerShell guy myself and do some minor Python on the side at work, but I never need to touch Linux scripts. Jumping into this class was a wake-upp call that I should have been practicing years before because of how capable Linux is as a platform. As i've mentioned before, my work runs a few servers off Linux, but after learning what I've learned in this class, I believe we are underutilizing Linux, and we can begin to integrate Linux far more in our workplace. That said, nothing changes the fact that scripting in Linux was my weakest aspect coming into this class, and after completing this course, I have vowed to practice far harder on my Linux scripting.

## 3. What was the most gratifying/best part?  Why?

The best part about this course was getting to work with Splunk. It's something that I've eyeballed for so many years, but I figured I would wait until an employer pays for my training because Splunk training is **so** costly, but when I saw we were covering Splunk, I was thrilled! I am obsessed with Splunk, and after completing several training courses, I cannot wait to dive back into the training models and get entrenched in training. The platform is just so versatile and powerful, which is so attractive to both me and employers. I truly can see Splunk taking over within the next 5-10 years because of how strong the demand for its skills is in the industry.

## 4.  What would you do differently in the future to avoid the frustrating/hard part?

In the future I would do a better job at becoming more well-rounded so that I can take on challenges that come my way without struggling so much. Tasks that should've taken me an hour took two because I needed to research & trial/errorÂ  within the scripts. Moving forward I will be more prepared and well-rounded for future courses or challenges, which will translate over to my professional life because I will be more experienced overall.

## 5. If you had a magic wand that could change anything about this Portfolio, what would it be and why?

If I could magically change one thing about this portfolio, I wish I was skilled enough to make it one of those really intricate interactive portfolios that I see when I was looking at the resource list for portfolios. I believe that those really poppy and animated portfolios are so eye-catching to prospective employers, but it's something I'm working on improving so that I can one day create something like that for myself.

## 6.  What grade would you give yourself for this Portfolio and why.

I believe that this portfolio is worthy of a B+ or A-. My goal was to introduce CSS/JS elements into the portfolio, but I was unable to do that due to time constraints, so I failed my mid-term goal there, but I believe that the quality of work presented shows my ability well, and I think that you can see the path of natural skill progression through my assignments in this course. Additionally, I believe that while I wasn't able to visually make my portfolio stand out, I think that it's formatted in such a way that employers could view the portfolio and quickly understand the level of work I am capable of and feel confident in their decision to hire me.

## 7.  If you were actually working at Acme corp what do you think your boss would say as your performance review?

If I were really working at Acme Corp, I believe that a 7-8/10 would be a fair grade for a performance review. The tasks that I completed were completed well and showed a lot of initiative and technique. I always tried to consider alternative perspectives that could influence our decision-making when it came to introducing changes into existing infrastructure. While scripting was a large challenge for me, I believe that I tackled it head-on and was able to overcome the blockers that I was facing. There's definitely room for improvement with initial revisions or delays on work completed, but overall I believe I do a great job worthy of a 7.5/10 for the performance review.

## 8.  If this was a real corporation, would you hire yourself based on your performance this term? Why or why not? What could you change in future to make yourself a more desirable hire?

If this was a real corporation, I would hire myself based on my performance in this term. I believe that the level of work I have produced is strong and that I presented myself through my work to be a competent and knowledgeable asset to any team. To make myself more attractive in the future, I have already made plans to practice scripting more and fully utilize my SplunkPledge 12-month education resource that I was given through this class. With both of these feathers in my cap, I believe that I would be an extremely attractive candidate to any employer.

## 9.  Is there anything else you would like to include? If yes, please do so now.

This class is a wonderful acceleration for everyone's Linux abilities. I thought I was confident on Linux at a beginner level, but I quickly realized I knew nothing at all. Yes, I stood up Snipe-IT or SFTP, TFTP servers on Linux, but that was nothing compared to the work we were completing in this course. The best way I can describe it is that this class was a humbling experience that has motivated me to fling myself deeper into the Linux rabbit hole in search of knowledge.
